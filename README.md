# Creating-Random-Thraeds
following is a C code, written for an OS proj under Dr. Won, 
that creates two threads. 
The first thread create a random number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.288, 0.993, 0, 1, 0.333) every second. 
The thread then write the generated number to a shared variable. 
The second thread reads the shared variable and prints out the value of the variable.
